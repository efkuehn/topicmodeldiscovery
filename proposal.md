# Topic Modeling as a Tool for Resource Discovery

Resource Discovery has changed dramatically over the last two decades as a
result of next-gen catalog technologies, particularly through an increased
ability to work around the limitations of subject thesauri by using keyword
search functions. We propose that topic modeling can make an
important contribution to resource discovery, especially in emerging fields of
study. Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that uses word clusters
as a way to differentiate text selection. Because topic modeling is
unsupervised it allows for naive exploration of corpus, helping the user
filter through thousands of documents to find relevant materials. This paper
builds on our previous exploratory study, "Indexing the Theologico-
Political", and demonstrates not only the organizational capabilities of topic
modeling, but also the predictive capabailities that are integral to library
resource discovery.
