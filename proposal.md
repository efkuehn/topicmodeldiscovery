# Topic Modeling as a Tool for Resource Discovery

Resource Discovery has changed dramatically over the last two decades as a
result of next-gen catalog technologies, particularly through an increased
ability to work around the limitations of subject thesauri by using keyword
search functions. We propose that topic modeling, which allows for 
sophisticated keyword clustering based on fulltext mining, can make an
important contribution to resource discovery, especially in emerging fields of
study. This paper builds on our previous exploratory study, "Indexing the
Theologico- Political", and demonstrates not only the organizational
capabilities of topic modeling, but also the predictive capabailities that are
integral to library resource discovery.
